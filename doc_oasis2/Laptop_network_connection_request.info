Since we now have to connect our laptop to the office once a month I would need an unused network plug get put in the Windows VLAN.

Free network plug: 574.D.1.022

It's located under the desk DRB D1/007E/desk15

If you need a reference plug (for the VLAN number), you could take the same as 574.D.1.025 where the Windows desktop PC 02DI20090014015 is connected.
