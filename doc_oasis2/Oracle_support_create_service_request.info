MOS - create a service request
--------------------------------

run an explorer: update-explorer
Output file in: /var/crash/explorer/

example: 
explorer.862148f8.<hostname>.cc.cec.eu.int-2017.03.07.06.49.tar.gz

copy the explorer file on the Linux WKS:
cp root@<hostname>:/var/crash/explorer/*.gz /var/tmp


If one cannot connect to the server, the create a snapshot from the ILOM (web)

To run the ILOM snapshot, please follow the instructions below: 

1) Open a web browser 

2) Enter the IP address for the ILOM's Net Mgmt port 

3) Log into the ILOM's web GUI with the "root" account 
(the default password from the factory is "changeme") 

4) Note the ILOM version listed on the first web page of output 

5) Click the "Maintenance" tab 

6) for ILOM 2.x: Click on the "Data Collector" sub tab 
for ILOM 3.x: Click on the "Snapshot" sub tab 

7) Make sure that "Normal" is selected and that "Logs Only" is Disabled or unchecked before click on the button to run the ILOM snapshot 

8) Save as .zip file (the ILOM snapshot output) to your local system from where you are running the web browser 

9) Email me the snapshot once it is done saving it (the ILOM snapshot will be really small, only 150 KB on average)
