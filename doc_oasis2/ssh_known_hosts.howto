Connection issue from progress for user bmcptrl: prompting for a password:

Solution:
add the host entry in the GlobalKnownHostsFile /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts like it's the case for the other hosts

--> run manually
chmod 600 know_hosts in the bmcptrl homedir/.ssh
ssh medusa (for axample)
answer "yes" --> this will add the entry in the known_hosts 
The add this entry to /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts 
Remove the entry in the bmcptrl homedir/.ssh/known_hosts
