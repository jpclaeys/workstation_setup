Hello


I added a new section MYSQL to the wiki page http://www.dcim.cc.cec.eu.int/wiki/view/UNIX/NetworkerClient to explain how to proceed with tickets of the following kind in a quick, easy way:

To be able to back up MY-SQL db, could you please :
- on Containter/MySQL server : myl0001.cc.cec.eu.int
- install following package:
Name/version : lgtonmda.x86_64      8.2.4.2-1
- configure the MySQL server in the proper cFengine group
mysqlDB

Thank you. Best regards
