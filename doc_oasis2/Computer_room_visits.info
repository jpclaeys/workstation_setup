Guys have in mind on planned interventions & computer room visits to send email to DIGIT CRAAC at least 24 hours before:
o	the details of the visitors: last name, first name, E.C. identification badge number (if any), company name, mobile number and E-mail address 
o	the DIGIT Computer Rooms concerned by the request 
o	the intervention timeframe (start date/time and end date/time) 
o	the reason for the visit and/or a detailed description of the intervention 
o	the references of the impacted equipment (name, serial number, inventory ID, rack and position) 
o	the supplier's reference for the intervention or E.C. SMT ticket number (optional) 
o	the E.C. framework contract or the E.C. official responsible for the intervention (optional) 
o	for urgent requests, the requestor's mobile phone number should also be provided, so that the CRS team can get back in touch with the requestor, even outside normal working hours
