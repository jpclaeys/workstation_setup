How do I install a .rpm file?


I think the easiest way is to open a terminal, navigate to the downloads folder

$ cd ~/Downloads

and then

$ sudo dnf install NAME_OF_RPM.rpm

$ cd $HOME/Downloads
To install for the first time use:

$ su -c "rpm -ihv your_file.rpm"
Or you can update an older version using:

$ su -c "rpm -Uhv your_file.rpm"
