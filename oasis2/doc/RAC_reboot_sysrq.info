Environment
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
Oracle RAC
Issue
Server has rebooted with the following output in the /var/log/messages file prior to the reboot:
Raw
Apr  3 11:35:14 <hostname> kernel: SysRq : Resetting
Apr  3 11:42:42 <hostname> syslogd 1.4.1: restart.
Apr  3 11:42:42 <hostname> kernel: klogd 1.4.1, log source = /proc/kmsg started.
Resolution
Identify the application that caused the SysRq to be triggered and disable it.
In case of Oracle RAC Node eviction, contact Oracle Clusterware Technical Support Team and verify the corresponding log files of Oracle Clusterware.
Root Cause
The SysRq facility received a "SysRq event" that caused it to report "Resetting". This is an indication that a user, or privileged process, initiated a SysRq reboot event (b).
Please see: How can I use the SysRq facility to collect information from a server which has hung ? 

In some cases, this message can be due to a node being fenced in Oracle RAC. By default Oracle Cluster Services Synchronization Daemon (CSSD) reboot the server during Oracle RAC node eviction.
Verify that the SysRq facility is currently activated on the system:
Raw
$ grep sysrq /etc/sysctl.conf 
kernel.sysrq = 1
sysctl on atlantis
1 root@atlantis:-> grep sysrq /etc/sysctl.conf
kernel.sysrq = 1
