Linux patching CAT example:
---------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAT clarifications:

For the upcoming Linux patching please put the following in the additional information:
Due to a security kernel patching (CVE-2016-7117), the impacted servers will need to be rebooted during this intervention

The justification should read something like:
"In order to respond to a known security bug, servers need to be patched in order to restore a good level of security"

And the subject should be something like:
System security patching and reboot

For the notification type, we should not use "Emergency" and instead use "Normal Maintenance"
Emergency should be reserved for real emergencies. Let's avoid screaming fire before there actually is a fire!

Also, the risk analysis should contain a real risk description like "Application compatibility issues" and the mitigation is to roll back to the previous version of packages.

Thanks
