Discovering Locks
When a commit fails due to someone else's locks, it's fairly easy to learn about them. The easiest way is to run svn status -u:

$ svn status -u <myfle>   # svn status --show-updates
1st column  'M': Item has been modified.
6th column  'K': File is locked in this working copy.
8th column  '*': A newer revision of the item exists on the server.

Breaking and Stealing Locks
A repository lock isn't sacredâ€”in Subversion's default configuration state, locks can be released not only by the person who created them, but by anyone. When somebody other than the original lock creator destroys a lock, we refer to this as breaking the lock.

svn unlock [--force] <myfle>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Reverting changes:

svn revert <filename>
ex. svn revert cc.cec.eu.int
svn status
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resolve conflicts:

svn resolve
svn diff
svn checkout

svn log -l 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
View differences between 2 versions:

svn diff -r <version1>:<version2>
# get svn diff of current and previous revision number
svn diff -c <version>
# see what the last commit did.
svn diff -r PREV:COMMITTED
# difference between your working copy and the last committed revision.
svn diff -r HEAD <item>
