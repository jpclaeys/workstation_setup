Collecting system information on a local system using removable media
The following procedure describes how to collect system information on a local system using removable
media.
Step 1. Insert the media into the system, and if necessary, mount the removable media.
Step 2. On a command line, change to the directory for the removable media.
Step 3. Enter the following command to collect system information:
lnvgy_utl_dsa__dsalxxx-10.x_portable_platform [-x] [-v] [-text]
where the and platform is the supported operating system.
This command creates compressed CIM-XML output by default. You can also create HTML output
by specifying the -v option and ASCII text output by specifying the -text option. If you specify
the -x option, compressed CIM-XML output is not created, and you must specify the -v or -text
option, or both.
