Howto cleanup var usage too high on linux
------------------------------------------

In some cases, atop logs are not cleaned up properly after log rotation.
If /var/cache/atop.d is too big, just restart the atop service

systemctl restart atop

The restart normaly cleans left over open file from the atop process.
