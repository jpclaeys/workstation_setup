slappasswd - OpenLDAP password utility
---------------------------------------
Slappasswd  is  used  to  generate  an  userPassword value suitable for use with ldapmodify(1), slapd.conf(5) rootpw configuration directive 
or the slapd-config(5) olcRootPW configuration directive.

OPTIONS
       -h "scheme"
              If -h is specified, one of the following RFC 2307 schemes may be specified: {CRYPT}, {MD5}, {SMD5},  {SSHA},  and  {SHA}.   The  default  is
              {SSHA}.

              Note that scheme names may need to be protected, due to { and }, from expansion by the user's command interpreter.

              {SHA} and {SSHA} use the SHA-1 algorithm (FIPS 160-1), the latter with a seed.

              {MD5} and {SMD5} use the MD5 algorithm (RFC 1321), the latter with a seed.

              {CRYPT} uses the crypt(3).

              {CLEARTEXT}  indicates that the new password should be added to userPassword as clear text.  Unless {CLEARTEXT} is used, this flag is incom‚Äê
              patible with option -g.


ex. 
[claeyje@ldapa-pk ~]# slappasswd -h {CRYPT}
New password: 
Re-enter new password: 
{CRYPT}pTma6.MERs7Kw
