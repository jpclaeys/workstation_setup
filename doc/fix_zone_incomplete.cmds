In order to online a Resource Group, the zone has to be in the 'configured' state, otherwise it will not stay up.

If a zone installation or uninstallation is interrupted, the zone is left in
the incomplete state. Use uninstall to reset such a zone back to the configured state.
zoneadm -z <zonename> uninstall
