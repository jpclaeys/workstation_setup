How to delete broken symlinks in one go
----------------------------------------

This simple one liner does the job quite fast, requires GNU find:

find . -xtype l -delete

A bit of explanation:
----------------------
-xtype l tests for links that are broken (it is the opposite of -type)

-delete deletes the files directly, no need for further bothering with xargs or -exec

NOTE: -xtype l means -xtype low case L (as in link)
