Disabling reverse dns lookups in ssh
-------------------------------------

Sometimes it is very annoying to wait ten’s of seconds to finish remote ssh server’s reverse dns lookup procedure. It can be disabled on the server side but this process has a few tricks.

First of all, you have to make “UseDNS no” in /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, default answer is yes and if this line not exists in your config file, just add it to as below:


UseDNS no


This directive tells sshd process to check resolved host name for the connected client’s ip address maps back to the very same ip address or not.

However, it does not prevent the sshd server from performing any DNS lookups at all. That’s not the purpose of that directive.

In order to remove dns lookups completely, you have to use -u0 options when starting sshd server.

You can easily add this options to /etc/default/ssh or /etc/sysconfig/sshd or elsewhere suitable for your distribution.

-u0 option’s means that it will not put hostnames into the utmp structure (i.e. what you see when you type “who” at the shell prompt), which means that sshd will not perform any DNS lookups for that purpose.

However there are still cases where a lookup has to be performed when a user has

from=<hostname>
like entries in his authorized_keys file, or when authentication methods or configuration directives are used that involve hostnames.

We are making an unnecessary DNS lookup from CoreOS nodes every time we connect to it.

I'd propose to make the default setting for UseDNS be No.

From the manpage of sshd_config(5):

 UseDNS  Specifies whether sshd(8) should look up the remote host name and
         check that the resolved host name for the remote IP address maps
         back to the very same IP address.  The default is “yes”.
Enabling this makes access from a location without proper (forward and reverse) DNS generate a warning in the logs.
