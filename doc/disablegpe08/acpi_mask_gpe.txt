                        Advanced Configuration and Power Interface
                        Due to the existence of _Lxx/_Exx, some GPEs triggered
                        by unsupported hardware/firmware features can result in
                        GPE floodings that cannot be automatically disabled by
                        the GPE dispatcher.
                        This facility can be used to prevent such uncontrolled
                        GPE floodings.
                        Format: <int>
                        Support masking of GPEs numbered from 0x00 to 0x7f.
