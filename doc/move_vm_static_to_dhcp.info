Good morning,

As discussed this morning, we’re going to export/import the CENTREON OWA today. 
Centreon will be unavailable for few hours. I’ll create the tickets to both teams. 

Please find below the procedure written by Martin, my changes are in bold. 

OP INFRA SYSTEM 
1)      disable puppet to prevent overwriting the modifications done further down
2)      backup /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts (DONE: /root/etc_sysconfig_network-scripts.tar)
3)      uninstall vmware tools (all *open-vm-tools* packages # maybe sufficient to DISABLE the system service “vmtoolsd.service”? No idea if the cloud import actually checks for the presence of the packages or only if the tools are running)
4)      disable backup interface: set eth1 to onboot=no in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth1
5)      move eth0 to dhcp: /etc/init.d/network stop; check if interfaces  are down: ip addr show; move away /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0, create a new one with content
DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
6)  /etc/init.d/network start; check if eth0 is in dhcp mode
7)  shutdown vm
8)      Contact VIRT TEAM (JM)

VIRT TEAM 
1)      Create the OWA
2)      Contact JCV when it’s done
3)      Boot the server
4)      Contact OP INFRA SYSTEM 

OP INFRA SYSTEM
1)      restore  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts from tar archive, /etc/init.d/network restart; yum install -y open-vm-tools.x86_64 && systemctl start vmtoolsd.service; systemctl start puppet
2)      Contact INT PROD + JCV

INT PROD: 
1)      check that centreon is up and running.
