Before Solaris 11.3 dynamically adding resources to zone does not work so we will reboot the zone. When the zone booted we will observe the change:

Currently S11.3 LZR (live zone reconfiguration) doesn't support dataset, as stated in "man -s 5 solaris":

"The following zoneadm(1M) resources and properties are not supported by
the live zone reconfiguration for solaris brand:

anet:allowed-address
anet:configure-allowed-address
anet:defrouter
dataset
file-mac-profile
fs-allowed
hostid
limitpriv
global-time
net:allowed-address
net:configure-allowed-address
net:defrouter
npiv
tenant
zpool"

That feature will be available in a future release of Solaris 11.
