# activate selinux 
-------------------

sed -i 's/SELINUX=disabled/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config && touch /.autorelabel

Next time when you will reboot the system, it will relabel the filesystem for SElinux automatically.

This usually occurs when labeling a file system for SELinux for the first time, or when switching between different types of policy, such as changing from the targeted to the strict policy.
