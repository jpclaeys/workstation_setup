Centreon snmp error for anninter_pz:

Nothing we can do about it. It’s because the orabkp filesystem is currently mounted:

Filesystem                                                     Size  Used Available Capacity Mounted
nfs-infra.isilon:/orabkp                                       2.1T  1.7T  381G   82% /home/orabkp

The zone is running Solaris 10, filesystems larger than 1TB will always cause an SNMP
error. This will go away as soon as the automounter drops the filesystem again.

23/07/2019: same issue on virtua-pz

same problem as last time. Solaris 10 SNMP doesn’t handle filesystems larger than 1TB properly:
nfs-infra.isilon:/intstore
                       2.1T   1.8T       240G    89%    /home/intstore

I’ve unmounted it manually, but the problem will come back as soon as someone accesses it again.
