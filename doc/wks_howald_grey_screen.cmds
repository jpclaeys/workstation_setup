If some of the workstations at Howald show only a grey screen (or black with a square cursor
at the upper left), the Display Manager (lightdm) service on opvmwstsx11 has crashed.
Solution:
log into opvmwstsx11, “su” to root and restart the service:
$ su -
password:
NB: pwd: OPv7in       (alias for linuxvm is pinguin: 7 characters)
# service lightdm restart
# service lightdm status
OR
/bin/systemctl restart lightdm.service
/bin/systemctl status lightdm.service
