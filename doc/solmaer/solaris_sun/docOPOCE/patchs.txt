Description 	

"special" patches are not released, so customer
can never get them.  They only show up on a
customer system as patch metadata.  When migrating
a zone, if the source had the special patch, but
the target is at a later release, there is no way
to bring the target up to sync with the source system
since the patch is not available and these patches
are never obsoleted.

Work Around 	

Install the attached bad_patches file in
/usr/lib/brand/native.
