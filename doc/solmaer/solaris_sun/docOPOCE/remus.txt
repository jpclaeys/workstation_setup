WARNING: The following files in / differ from the boot archive:

    changed /kernel/drv/sgen.conf
    changed /kernel/drv/did.conf

The recommended action is to reboot to the failsafe archive to correct
the above inconsistency. To accomplish this, on a GRUB-based platform,
reboot and select the "Solaris failsafe" option from the boot menu.
On an OBP-based platform, reboot then type "boot -F failsafe". Then
follow the prompts to update the boot archive. Alternately, to continue
booting at your own risk, you may clear the service by running:
"svcadm clear system/boot-archive"
