Dear all,

Problem has been fixed.

We had to kill all httpdWeb processes and after that we are able to start a service like usually:

Useful commands for this:

ps -fu cportal | grep httpdWeb | gawk -F' ' '{print $2}'   #     show all PIDS for httpdWeb processes

ps -fu cportal | grep httpdWeb | gawk -F' ' '{print $2}' | xargs -n 1 kill -9 # kill all existing httpdWeb processes

./cportal_apache start
Starting httpd:                                            [  OK  ]
