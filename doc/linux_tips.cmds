# kworker high cpu issue
-------------------------
# Increase log level

type the following command a few times
echo 1 > /proc/sysrq-trigger
... and watch the log using dmesg command


# workaround

[root@brutus ~]# cat /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
500

echo 10000 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty_writeback_centisecs
...which overwrites the default value of 500.
Why does this (hopefully) fix my issue? No clue.
